# Js

Js will be the area where workers can access to carry out their tasks and control the process. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

## Add CSS from Angular-CLI

I have chosen SASS, becouse Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

## Add Material for Front

`$ ng add @angular/material`
`$ npm i @angular/flex-layout`
`$ npm i @angular/cdk`
`$ npm i highcharts-angular --save`
`$ npm i highcharts --save`
`$ npm i @angular/ --save`
`$ npm i material-components-web`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
