# Js

Js will be the area where workers can access to carry out their tasks and control the process. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

## Add CSS from Angular-CLI

I have chosen SASS, becouse Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

## Add Material for Front

`$ npm i material-components-web`
